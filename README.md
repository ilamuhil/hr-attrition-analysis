# HR Attrition Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for the HR department to forecast employee attrition. It also seeks to provide insights into the factors contributing to attrition, enabling HR to implement corrective or preventive measures to manage employee turnover effectively. This is a typical binary classification problem

## Objective

The primary objective is to predict employee attrition and identify key factors that influence attrition rates. This analysis will help HR departments in taking strategic actions to improve employee retention.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes related to employees, which are described below:

- **Age:** Age of the employee (continuous variable).
- **Attrition:** Status of attrition (dichotomous variable, values: Yes, No).
- **BusinessTravel:** Frequency of official travel (categorical variable: Non-Travel, Travel_Frequently, Travel_Rarely).
- **DailyRate:** Daily rate of the employee (continuous variable).
- **Department:** Department of the employee (categorical variable: Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales).
- **DistanceFromHome:** Distance from home to office in km (continuous variable).
- **Education:** Education level rated from 1 to 5 (ordinal categorical variable).
- **EducationField:** Field of education (categorical variable: Human Resources, Life Sciences, Marketing, Medical, Other, Technical Degree).
- **EmployeeCount:** Count of employees (constant).
- **EmployeeNumber:** Employee identification number (ID variable).
- **EnvironmentSatisfaction:** Job environment satisfaction rated from 1 to 4 (ordinal categorical variable).
- **Gender:** Gender of the employee (categorical variable: Female, Male).
- **HourlyRate:** Hourly rate of the employee (continuous variable).
- **JobInvolvement:** Engagement in the job rated from 1 to 4 (ordinal categorical variable).
- **JobLevel:** Level of job in organizational structure rated from 1 to 5 (ordinal categorical variable).
